          <p>Coffee is a popular drink with many people in the world. This is evident from the number of coffee chains across the globe like Starbucks and Café Coffee Day, which are gaining increasing popularity.</p>
            <p>The popular coffees on a menu are Espresso, Café Latte, Macchiato, Choc Latte, etc. that may have added milk, or other ingredients like nutmeg. The taste ranges from bitter [as in an Espresso] to mild sweet [as brewed in some parts of India], served with a large helping of milk and sugar. Instant coffee needs no brewing. Cold coffee is also a popular milk based drink. In many recipes, especially desserts, such as Tiramisu and some Ice Creams, coffee is used as a popular flavouring agent.</p>
